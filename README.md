**"A genetically informed pipeline for drug repurposing in Type 2 Diabetes using Bayesian multi-trait gene set models"**

## Study Overview
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex polygenic disorder with limited success in therapeutic translation despite numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this study, we developed and applied a **Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) gene set framework** to integrate GWAS summary statistics with curated drug-gene interaction data from the **Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb)**.

We prioritized druggable gene sets, evaluated at the **ATC 4th level**, by calculating **posterior inclusion probabilities (PIP)** for each set. Our findings:
- Validated the model by identifying strong genetic associations for known antidiabetic agents
- Highlighted additional candidate drug classes with genetic relevance to T2D, including:
  - Carboxamide derivatives
  - Fibrates
  - Uric acid inhibitors
  - Immunomodulatory and antineoplastic agents  
- Identified **key T2D-associated genes** such as *PPARG*, *KCNQ1*, *TNF*, and *GCK*
- Suggested **bezafibrate**, a PPAR pan-agonist, as a potential repurposing candidate
